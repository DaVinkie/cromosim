Cellular automata
=================

Cellular Automata models are microscopic in the sense that agents are
represented individually, but they are also natively discrete in both space
and time.
In space: agents are identified to particles located in cells of a
fixed cartesian grid, with an exclusion rule (one particle at most in each
cell).
In time: the evolution consists of a succession of steps, i.e. positions of
particles are updated one after the other, in a stochastic manner.
